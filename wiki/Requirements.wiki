#summary GWT-Validation Requirements
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Requirements =

 * The [GWTVF] API shall conform to basic aspects of the JSR-303 specification
  *  A constraint specifies:
   *   The class that implements the checking of the constraint.
   *   Parameters to initialize the parameters of the constraint.
   *   The groups under which the constraint should be checked.
   *   The message to be returned when the specified constraint fails.
  *  The user shall be able to annotate the following with constraints:
   *   Classes
   *   Fields
   *   Methods
  *  The Validation procedure will follow the methodology and ordering as specified by JSR-303.
  *  The API shall implement the GroupSequence annotation as specified by JSR-303.
   *   GroupSequence shall have a group name.
   *   GroupSequence shall specify a sequence of groupings to run.
  *  The API shall provide identical validation procedures for the client side JavaScript and pure JVM code.
  *  The user shall be able to correlate messages on constraints to external message strings.
   *   Intended to support internationalization or multiple sites sharing the same validation.
   *   The API shall provide this support through the standard internationalization package of GWT.
