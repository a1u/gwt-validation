#summary How to build gwt-validation from Source Control
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Checkout =

First use the Source tab to check the content out from the repository.

= Dependencies =

  * JUnit 4 (for testing)
  * GWT libraries (gwt-dev-platform.jar, gwt-user.jar)

  These libraries are usually placed in the ./lib/ directory.  Something may be done in    the future to ensure that proper dependencies are downloaded as part of the build process.

= Building =

The build process was written using ant 1.7.

Targets:
 * clean - removes all intermediate files
 * test - runs just the unit tests
 * dist - runs the tests and builds the distributable jar
 * dist-no-test - builds the distributable jar without running any tests
