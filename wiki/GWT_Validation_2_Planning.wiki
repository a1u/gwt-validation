#summary planning for gwt-validation-2.0

= Introduction =

Even though the gwt sdk will include (some) JSR-303 compatibility with version 2.3 or 2.4 it still requires (from what knowledge is available) a non-client check of the file for constraint violations.  This is, at the very least, undesirable.

= Why? =

It is entirely possible to create a fully, or almost fully, complete JSR-303 validation solution, with GWT, that has the following features:

 * No special markers - naturally, fluently, use the JSR-303 (javax.validation) annotations without marker interfaces or annotations.

 * Metadata support - all of javax.valiation.metadata is supported.

 * All levels of validation (field, class, cascading).

 * Full group, message, and payload support.

 * Composed constraint support.

 * Full i8n support.
