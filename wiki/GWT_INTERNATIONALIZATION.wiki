= Description =

The GWTVF implements i18n as described in the JSR-303 specification (v1.0 final).  The full details can be found in section 4.3.

= Files =

The JSR-303 specification specifies that the resource bundle pattern {{{/ValidationMessages.properties}}} should be used to specify the resources.  The following files would specify a default locale, an English locale, a French locale, and a Spanish locale.

{{{
/ValidationMessages.properties
/ValidationMessages_en.properties
/ValidationMessages_fr.properties
}}}

The {{{/}}} location refers to the root of the classpath.

These files behave as a [http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html ResourceBundle] would behave.

= Usage =

In order to use the i18n features you must do the following:

 # Create the {{{/ValidationMessages}}} property files
 # Add the appropriate locales to your `<module`>.gwt.xml 
 # Use the validation framework as normal
